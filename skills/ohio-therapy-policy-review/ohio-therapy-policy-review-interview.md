## Summary of Interview Findings

### Review Approach
- Review documents **as a package** - content matters, not document structure
- Required provisions may be in **non-standard locations**
- Compare against **reference templates** as baseline
- **No severity tiers** - reviewing attorney determines priority based on experience
- **All findings must be addressed** before returning to client

### What to Flag
- **Conflicts** with template requirements
- **Missing items** from templates
- **Ambiguous language**
- **Internal contradictions** within customer's documents

### What is Acceptable
- **More robust than templates** = customer choice, note but don't flag
- Only flag extra provisions if they **contradict** required elements or themselves

### Output Format
- **Summary at top** of report
- **Detailed findings** with document name, page, section location
- **Redline files** (markdown or Word) for easy client acceptance

### Document Requirements
- **AI Consent:** Preferred as standalone document, acceptable if integrated
- **Telehealth:** Current paragraph in Informed Consent is sufficient
- **Templates are Ohio-compliant minimum** - skill should verify, not assume missing
